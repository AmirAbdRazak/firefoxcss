# Firefox CSS: A mod from the original Flying Fox by Akshat46
### https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox
The mod broke on my pc for whatever reason so this is basically my edit for it, albeit jank.

## Steps 
1- Add the `chrome` and the `user.js` folder inside your profile folder. You can find your profile folder by typing `about:profiles` inside the url bar and select one folder </br>
2 - Download the Tree Style Tabs plugin and go to the Advanced section. This can be done by typing `about:addons` inside the URL bar </br>
3- Copy the code inside `treestyletab.css` and paste it inside the Advanced section inside the extension.


### This should work but if it doesn't then I do not know, `user.js` might be jank I only inputted that because the original guy did
